PReticulated is a simple WPF app that converts PDF's into PNG's. 

It was made to speed up what was currently a slow process, conversion of PDF's to PNG's. Whilst making content applications in the past, when PDF's were being displayed in the app the codebase the team and I were using required PDF's represent each page as a PNG. 

To do this in the past, we were using a conversion tool created by Adobe and performed on their website. This just didn't quite cut it for us for a few reasons.

Whilst having some down-time at work for R&D, I created the app with these reasons in mind;

* I wanted this product myself
* The team workflow would be sped up and improved
* A nice opportunity to get comfortable using a new Library
* Something fun to make
* Something a bit different
	
Work on this project won't happen too often, but so far it's had some open-source contributions on Github. There's a few features I want to put in, as well as maybe making it look nicer - it currently looks like it's come from the 2000's.

I'll have some features/bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/KieranBond/PReticulated/issues">issues</a> section, if you want to see what's next for the app.

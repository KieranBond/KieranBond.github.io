TinYard is a C# Framework.

TinYard aims to improve your code by providing an easy-to-use IoC container and more through its powerful but simple extensibility.

The framework provides a few tools to help you do this, such as;

* [Dependency Injection / IoC](https://github.com/TinYard/TinYard#IInjector)
* [Event System](https://github.com/TinYard/TinYard#Event-System-Extension)
* [Command System](https://github.com/TinYard/TinYard#Command-System-Extension)
* [MVC Suite](https://github.com/TinYard/TinYard#MVC-Bundle)

It's also super easy to extend as it's a modular project.

I created this project for a few reasons;

* I wanted to build something useful that isn't an app.
* I wanted to get a better understanding of the <a href="https://github.com/robotlegs-sharp/robotlegs-sharp-framework">framework that inspired this</a>, at a design level.
* A chance to get to use some design philosophy I'd been reading.
* Something different, that requires lots of continuous love.
	
This seems to be quite a long-term project to me, as I'm sure there'll always be more to do with it or more ways to improve it. It will probably have plenty of refactors as I understand what I'm desiring more, and get further into creating it.

I'll have some features/bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/TinYard/TinYard/issues">issues</a> section, if you want to see what's next for the framework.

I've been enjoying this project! I want to make it a genuinely viable Framework to use when using C#, for more people than just me.

It's not all completely new things, as it's heavily inspired by a framework that I've used a lot at work - Making this geared more towards improving my design philosophy than anything else (not to say I'm not learning some technical things along the way).

Something I've realised from working on TinYard so far is that I definitely don't long-term plan my pet projects as much as I should. A lot of TinYard so far has been not properly planned out and improvised. I've definitely improved on this since starting it and most of the early teething-pains are non-existant now.

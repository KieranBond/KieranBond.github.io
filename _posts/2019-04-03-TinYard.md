TinYard is a C# Framework.

At its basics, the framework is to help you create an application with an Event System at the core of it.

The framework provides a few tools to help you do this, such as;

* Dependency Injection
* An Event System
* Value Mapping

I created this project for a few reasons;

* I wanted to build a useful something that isn't an app.
* I wanted to get better understandings of the <a href="https://github.com/robotlegs-sharp/robotlegs-sharp-framework">framework that inspired this</a>, at a design level.
* A chance to get to use some design philosophy I'd been reading.
* Something different, that requires lots of continuous love.
	
This seems to be quite a long-term project to me, as I'm sure there'll always be more to do with it or more ways to improve it. It will probably have plenty of refactors as I understand what I'm desiring more, and get further into creating it.

I'll have some features/bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/KieranBond/TinYard/issues">issues</a> section, if you want to see what's next for the framework.

I've been enjoying this project! I want to make it a genuinely viable Framework to use when using C#, for more people than just me.

It's not all completely new things, as it's heavily inspired by a framework that I've used a lot at work - Making this geared more towards improving my design philosophy than anything else (not to say I'm not learning some technical things along the way).

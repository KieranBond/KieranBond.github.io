Trash and Dash, a 4 player game created in a 30 hours (we like sleep, so it was around 24 hours for us). 

Trash and Dash was made in Unity3D, by a team of 6. 3 Programmers, 3 Artists.

As this was just a few days after our final submission, we all went into the Games Jam with the goal of just having fun. 
We certainly did!

The goal of the game is to collect as much trash as you can and deliver it to your barge - the player with the highest score wins.
We may, or may not of taken influence from Hungry Hippos.. (shhh)

Whilst you're doing this, a number of obstacles will pop up in your way or move across the area to interrupt you. You're also juggling this with
fighting off the other players who can hit you with their paddles to make you drop the trash you're holding - Make sure to give them a whack if they
grab any of your trash before you though!

The bits I mostly worked on:
- Obstacle Spawning, moving, and interrupting
- A quick whitebox
- Audio implementing
- Making the UI a bit more jazzy
- Having fun with my team!

<h2> Resources </h2>

Download the build <a href="https://github.com/KieranBond/TrashAndDash-GJ-19/releases/tag/v1.0">here.</a> You'll have to un-zip the download, and then run the 'TrashNDash.exe' file.

The game requires controllers to play, preferably grab 3 other people and get them to join you too!

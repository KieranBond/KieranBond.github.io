Mini-Spotify (working title) is a minified version of the Spotify Player, meets the Windows media panel. 

It's designed to give you the important information, but in a smaller package.

I created this project for a few reasons;

* I wanted this product myself
* A chance to get some experience with WPF and XAML
* A nice opportunity to get comfortable using an API
* Something fun and fresh
	
I'll be working on this project when I have more features I want to implement, or at the least until I'm happy with it.

I'll have some features/bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/KieranBond/MiniSpotify/issues">issues</a> section, if you want to see what's next for the app.

So far, I've enjoyed this project! It's been a bit of a fresh break from games, as it's one of the first things I've started since finishing University. 
It's not all completely new things, except WPF, but it's still all stuff I've not really worked with much or atleast not in quite a long time and so it's nice 
to stretch my skills a bit and practice with a slightly different toolset.

Bulb is a mobile game that I created, based on a simple colour flipping mechanic in an endless runner environment. 

Whilst the reason for making Bulb came from a University assignment about Indie game companies and monetisation, it was a project/product I really enjoyed making.   

Bulb was made in Unity3D, using C# to create the scripts needed - along with some simple art created in Photoshop, or acquired online where my skills lacked!

Bulb also has GoogleAds integrated to provide monetisation, using interstitial ads between each death.

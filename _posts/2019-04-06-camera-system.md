This project is a camera system developed to be used in Unity3D (primarily for 2D games). 
    

	
I created this project whilst in my final year of University, for a module called the Individual Research Project - This is the closest thing we have to a dissertation on the course.

For the assignment I had to do two things; research a topic of my choosing, and then create a practical piece in relation to this.

My research topic was: 'An investigation into improving user experience through game camera implementation'. This topic stemmed from my time playing games where I had experienced poor camera systems, as well as when I'd experienced great cameras that massively affected the gameplay.

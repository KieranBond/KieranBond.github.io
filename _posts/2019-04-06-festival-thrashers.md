<center>Festival Thrashers - A couch co-op party mayhem game.</center>
     
Festival Thrashers is a game made during my final year at University for my group project module. 
Our aim as a team was to create a super satisfying and fun game that can be played around a friends house, on their sofa. We wanted it to be in a polished state throughout development so that we can focus on the fun as we make it.

The team was 5 person big, with 3 artists and 2 programmers; me included.

My job as a programmer on this game mostly consisted of getting our game systems working, systems such as networking and game/scene management.
I also partially worked on some gameplay mechanics, such as multiple traps in the levels.

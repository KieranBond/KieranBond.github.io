I'm a final year Undergrad Student at the University of Gloucestershire, studying Computer Games Programming.

Across 2017 and 2018, I worked as a member of the Digital team at Squint/Opera as a Developer on a year long placement. I've learnt and grown a lot from that experience; in professionality, skill, and attitude. The placement provided me with the opportunity of working on a variety of projects, alongside a great team who pushed me to grow and challenged me often.

I love being active and getting my creative juices flowing. Whether that's through doing sports like Kayaking, exploring a game idea, a tool side project, or just trying to learn something new. If I'm not doing any of these, then you can likely find me with friends - Gaming or out and about!

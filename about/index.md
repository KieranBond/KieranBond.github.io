I'm a University of Gloucestershire alumni, who studied Computer Games Programming from 2015 until 2019 - after which, I graduated with a first. Originally, I hail from the nearby city of Bath.

Across 2017 and 2018, I worked as a member of the Digital team at Squint/Opera as a Developer on a year long placement. I learned and grew a lot from that experience in professionality, skill, and attitude. The placement provided me with the opportunity of working on a variety of projects alongside a great team who pushed me to grow, challenged me often and nurtured my abilities.

At Squint/Opera most of my work was with the Unity3D engine, which we used in not so traditional ways to create a variety of different applications for clients. Alongside this I also got to aid in the creation of other systems outside of the engine - often using one or more of C#, Node.js, or Powershell. 

I went on to complete my final year of University after my placement, and pulled myself out the end with a first!

After University I joined the company DBpixelhouse - And I'm still there now!

At DBpixelhouse I've been using more of the Unity3D engine and C# alongside it. I've been working on a variety of projects where I've been utilising technologies such as VR, AR, and more to create apps that wow clients and exceed their expectations.

Alongside this I've been actively leading the charge on learning new tech and improving my knowledge so that we can utilise it across the company and create more amazing pieces for our clients.

I love being active and getting my creative juices flowing. One of the major things that drives me to love development as a profession and a hobby is the ability to continuously learn and figure out how things work - and then get to create even more things with that new understanding!

In my downtime you can usually find me doing sports like Kayaking, exploring a game idea, a tool/side project, or just trying to learn something new. If I'm not doing any of these, then the next best place to find me is either with friends, playing video games, or searching for good coffee.
